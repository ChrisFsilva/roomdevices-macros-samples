The macro is made available to Cisco partners and customers as a convenience to help simplify deploying the Multi-Content Solution. Cisco does not permit the use of this library in customer deployments that do not include Cisco Video Endpoint Hardware.

## Support Notice
[Support](http://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/support) for the macros is provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the macro is properly integrated into 3rd party applications. This is particularly true if the  Multi-Content Solution is customized.

It is Cisco's intention to ensure macro compatibility across versions as much as possible and Cisco will make every effort to clearly document any differences in the xAPI across versions in the event that a backwards compatibility impacting change is made.
